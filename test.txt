This man must be so fed up with Americans.
You can thank your boss for that.
Ya don't say?
It’s a dumb time to be smart in America
Republicans spent decades waging war on science/facts. This is the end result of that
Which political party helped bring this bias into mainstream policy making? Could it be the party which had hitched its wagon to the Christian Right so had to maintain (being charitable) a studied on Creationism/Intelligent Design?

Republicans have become bad for public health.
By the time this is done, Fauci is going to be looking like the guy in "[The Scream](https://render.fineartamerica.com/images/rendered/default/print/6/8/break/images/artworkimages/medium/1/24-the-scream-edvard-munch.jpg)" painting.
Ignorance is pandemic in America.
It’s not anti-science. I mean sure, there’s always been a strong anti-intellectual streak in some parts. But nowadays, it’s not anti science in my mind as much as it’s bad news.

Science is fine when it’s iPhones and SpaceX and American exceptionalism with military might and militarized police. Maybe throw in dark matter or gravitational waves if it’s an American person or institute that discovered it.

It’s only when science deviates from political propaganda that it’s a problem. Global warming’s a hoax when it detracts from drilling and mining. Covid-19 is not bad or behind us when it’s impact commerce. Medication is bad to talk about because it might bring up a desire for nationalized healthcare.

That sort of shit.
“Anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.'” 

Isaac Asimov
The biggest anti-science loudspeaker though is his own boss.
Americans dislike being told how to act by some higher authority. They're often too independently minded and think they know as much as the experts. No one can infringe on "freedom," not even scientists/doctors, in the minds of many Americans.

I think it's also because of general distrust for government and the constant assumptions that there's some deep state or conspiracy lurking everywhere. Scientists, often employed by the government or funded by it, then get caught up in this distrust.
Thats the big difference between 1918 and today. You have a large amount of people who don't believe scientists, doctors and experts today.

It’s time to crack open a Brawndo.
Bro-science and Joe Rogan > Real science and career scientists
>anti-science bias

fueled by the far right propaganda saturating social media.

ffs the amount of people i see posting anti-vax Fauci/Gates/Soros conspiracy bullshit on facebook. and these are not grandmas.. it’s middle aged adults and young parents who completely lack critical thinking skills.

right wing anti-science propaganda is a weapon of mass destruction.
This is not new. The term egghead was not a positive.

Then there is this novel.

A Canticle for Leibowitz
1959

>After 20th century civilization was destroyed by a global nuclear war, known as the "Flame Deluge", there was a violent backlash against the culture of advanced knowledge and technology that had led to the development of nuclear weapons. During this backlash, called the "Simplification", anyone of learning, and eventually anyone who could even read, was likely to be killed by rampaging mobs, who proudly took on the name of "Simpletons". Illiteracy became almost universal, and books were destroyed en masse.

Or irl the Cultural Revolution or the Killing Fields of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge were intelligence was cleared out.
Yeah no shit, and he was happy to go right along with Trump and humor his ego along with Birks and talk out of both sides of their mouth.
Whatever. I heard Trump can count to Potato.
Where’s Carl Sagan when you need him 

>	Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.
The first thing a despotic government does is to get rid of the intellectuals: Soviet union, China, Cambodia...it's the playbook.
noshit.gif.jpeg.png.bmp
It's like the anti-intellectual bias of 1930's Nazi Germany. When facts get in the way, facts are the enemy.
If you want to know what the future of the US looks like, watch Idiocracy.
Anti intellectualism started with Bush's strategy of using a faux down home charm to gain the trust of working class whites.  

The problem is that it set the stage for Sarah Palin and her full-on assault on "east coast elites" (read: academics and people who went to college). The difference is that her schtick was real, and born a generation forever tied to the Tea Party movement who *sincerely* rejected science, academics, and journalism.    

That movement was then co opted and funded by super capitalists on the right (Koch Bros, et al) who used rejection of science to push anti climate policies, and rejection of journalism to dismiss critiques as attacks knowing it would give them a zero resistance path to deregulation, the dismantling of unions, lower wages, and a reduction of taxpayer funded social programs.  

At some point, someone (probably Roger Stone) led Trump to grasp what was going on with anti journalism/science/etc. in politics, and he played the part. The problem with THAT is that Trump really is that dumb, and didn't understand how to pump the brakes. So while he's barrelling full speed into a sharp turn he'll never make, which is fine (the turn is November, for those who aren't into analogies), he actually has the wellbeing of the nation hitched to his butt.

So the worse he does, the bigger the November landslide will be, but also the worse off the US will be in the short term. An economic crisis and a public health crisis he doesn't grasp, and the only people that could possibly nudge him in the right direction— his base— think they literally know more than the doctors and academics that are working to design solutions to save us.

Biden is going to have a lot of cleanup to do in January.

Also: we really need to trash the EC. Giving uninformed yokels bonus points on election day is the worst thing anyone could have done.
It's understandable for laypeople to distrust scientists when they flip flop as bad as politicians.
Is he saying windmill noise *doesn’t* cause cancer?
Ignorance is bliss and in their minds Trump supporters are some of the most blissed out people ever.
Everyone in the comments went so political. But I think a lot of anti-science bias comes from pop culture. There's a gigantic mad bad scientist trope in Hollywood.
The ironic part being that they use things created by science to try and spread their anti-science beliefs.
There is a concerning number of people in America that will never trust people in governmental/academic positions. They are against scientific fact and would rather have a theocracy than vaccinate their children. How do you educate people that refuse to be educated?
This pandemic has been a failure from day one the Trump administration is a joke vote this buffoon out of office Dumb Trump in November
It's not just an American problem either.
Media does a shit job with science even if it’s not on purpose. But most of the time it is on purpose because most of them are shit people.
This coming from the medical deep state?? I don’t think so!!!
We don’t deserve Fauci.
Look to one party for this shit.
semi-obligatory reminder: ["Science is a liar sometimes!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgk8UdV7GQ0)
Alexis de Tocqueville mentioned America’s anti-intellectualism in his book back in the early 1800s.

The R’s have capitalized on it since at least the 1950s.  Repeatedly attacking “teachers”, and ensuring massive student loans hobble those who go to university.

Truly tragic.  We could be so much better as a nation.  If it weren’t for politics getting in the way.
Don't wear a mask, no I mean wear a mask. Don't get tested cause only sick people need them, no i mean everyone get tested. Close down entire economy, no you can open if everyone wears a mask and gets tested (see #1 and 2).

It's not anti-science bias. Science looked foolish for the past 4 months. Predictions change by the day and sometimes by the hour. Toddlers and geriatrics given the same protocols. No clear messages other than no matter what people do, they are doing something wrong.

Stop blaming the population when you cant even be clear on simple predictions or recommendations. Anti-science bias....this friggin guy!!!
Reeeeally? Anti science in the US? How ridiculous, next you’re going to tell me the sky is blue.
Gee, welcome to America, Tony.
At least everybody is armed to the teeth
You mean the republican party?  Yeah it's a problem.
We know Fauci. We know.
Is he talking about #ShutDownSTEM?
I would like to also take this opportunity to warn everyone that the sky is blue.
Amen brother
You think?
Sadly lots of stupid ass people In the states that love being stupid , pride themselves on being anti intellectual
I’ve been reading my way through a book called The Gilded Dinosaur, and while it mostly covers the lives of two paleontologists who ruined each other’s careers through needless competition, it begins by saying that anti-scientific thought has always been a part of the DNA of the US. Politicians scoffed at the idea of funding research on basically anything, even saying shit like “why do we even need to know how animals work?” Like people HATED science, and it wasn’t until people realized you could use science to turn a profit that it began to catch on.
Same person that admitted government  lied to America about masks because they were nervous that hospitals wouldn't have enough? Maybe stop doing that if you want people to believe scientists?
The GOP is a problem for everyone.
We're waaay past the warning stages. This has been in the making for the last 2 decades.
Translation...the real problem is Trump and his fucking cult of morons.
Science has a well known liberal bias.
And in other news, water is wet.   I've seen this first hand in my own family.
“I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...

The dumbing down of American is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance”


― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark

(Just replace crystals and horoscopes with smartphones and Facebook and he fuckin nailed it)
Thanks for the warning, it's been happening since Galileo.

It's like BLM, it's not a warning, it's pointing out something inherently evil in society that people have lived with for generations of complacency.
Fauci basically admitted they lied to the public about masks to keep them for medical professionals.


How many people died because they didn't say "at least wear a bandana" from the beginning?

He's way off my good guy list. Fuck that guy.

Edit: Jesus Christ reddit hate to shit on your sovereign saint but he did fucking lie, and the admitted to it yesterday.  Here is Rising talking about it.

https://youtu.be/_2MmX2U2V3c
Thank you captain obvious
There are two kinds of science: Republican Science and Science.
Life imitating art. Idiocracy in real life.
Ya think?
In other news, water is wet.
Well to be fair most of us have watched scientests and medical experts be proven wrong over and over again. So there is logic in having some doubts and doing ones own research before believing what came out of someones mouth.

However what usually happens is people are to lazy to do the research and so simply start dismissing anything that is not convenient to them.

A properly educated people are a free people and a healthy people.
If you need someone to warn you about this, you have not been paying attention for the last several years. People believe whatever suites them best unfortunately...
That's a polite way of calling people stupid. I'd love to see Fauci lose it on air and drop F bombs.
So good. We made belief in science a partisan issue. Christ.
The country chock full of churches and religious based bias has an issue with anti-science bias? no way.....
Fun fact, our money used to have the phrase 'Science and Industry'. How far we have fallen.
Stupidity and ignorance are worn as badges of pride by so many in America and it starts at a young age.  Kids bragging about how bad they are at math, chastising other kids who are exceptional, or specifically targeting girls who are intellectual.  

The US simultaneously has the most brilliant and most idiotic population in the world, but I worry that balance is moving in the wrong direction.
They rather believe in God cure all type of deal rather than science. 


I believe in mathematics and science.
The President should look into this...
Jesus. Yes. Obviously. This is such a polite way of saying it.
Isaac Asimov said what now?
Meanwhile I see morons on my Facebook feed spamming articles that Fauci funded the secret Wuhan lab that created COVID-19 after screeching about bat soup for 3 months.
OH NO SHIT.

The past 30 years of my life have been spent wondering what the fuck is wrong with America.
In other news, there appears to be a positive correlation between clouds and the occurrence of rain.
I think Fauci is smug and does not really know what he is talking about.
Why is Dr. Fauci taking jabs at Joe Rogan??
I'm not siding with anyone on this but supposedly within the same week we had two different states saying beaches were opening, one saying the sand was bad and water was okay & one saying the water was bad sand was okay. Different messages coming from many different parties all with scientists and doctors behind them. I know some were most likely shills but it's reasonable to be sceptical of all messages when there are many different messages.
"Science? I'm an American, I have freedom"
Society has had an Anti-Science bias problem for almost 600 years.
[deleted]
Yeah no shit, egghead.
Ya think?
Understatement of the year.
It's always been there.  But it is frustrating.  Especially when lying politicians use it to introduce things like "peak oil", "clean coal", and conversion "therapy"
I think you mean "among Republicans"...
Welcome to 1991
Like the people who think COVID is going to take a break because of protesting?
He's as good as gone.
You found a clue Sherlock!
Yeah? Well what's he know!? /s
Well when the majority of the country are uneducated morons what does he expect?
I wonder if this is because science (and math) is considered hard to understand.

It’s easier to say plants grow from the sun and water gave us versus explaining photosynthesis.
yeah well, when science directly contradicts religion that people rely on to not freak out about death, naturally there's going to be some pushback against it
Yeah these kids looting and protesting all have STEM degrees...NOT. This isn’t fucking rocket science. Basically everyone stfu and let’s see where this movement goes...no where. So many more black men have died since George and no one cares “enough”. You can clearly see people turning towards voting for  trump.

...yeah when we’re watching the looters and rioters on tv we’re all thinking these are people of high intellect. When we see 16 year old kids with no accomplishments talking about how oppressed they are we really identify with that knowing we’ve been in their same shoes and the only difference was parents that weren’t pieces of shit. 

God damn. In the news today “people are stupid as fuck.” Wow so new an interesting.
Wonder what he’s eventually going to say that gets him fired?
So, serious question: where did all of the coronavirus coverage go?  I mean, for over two months it was literally 24/7,  twice daily death toll updates, but now cases are exploding everywhere as countries open back up and you have to dig to find any new information.
Flat earthers, anti vaxxers and Trump supporters are destroying the USA with such pride.
This is known
*Rightwing* anti-science bias
Let’s follow the idea of “service guarantees citizenship” 

That’ll fix things 
/S
we know... we all know. we are seeing it everywhere....
yeah you think? this is why we've been calling Anti-Vaxers dumb for so long.
Yeah, many of us have known this for some time now, considering people still believe the earth is flat... what the hell gave you the first clue?
Anti Science?

I'd go further and say it is becoming anti-intellectual.
He's absolutely correct. Because we have a President who does thought Coronavirus was a hoax and Global Warming is fiction. It's stems from poor leadership at the top!
This is the guy that just came out saying that he lied to us on purpose about masks being ineffective... excuse me if I’m gonna take what he says with a grain of salt
We haven't always been "anti-science".  What could have changed?  Let me think. Chemtrails?  Soros?  Bill Gates?  No?  Seems like things started getting dumbed down around 2016.  I'm trying to think what it could be.  Who it could be?

You think?
How is it not already a problem? Lol
Ya think!
[removed]
We shouldn’t be anti-science, but at the same time we can’t accept science as the 100% absolute truth. There are too many people who take the extreme view of disregarding science (which is ridiculous in my opinion, I love science), as well as the extreme view of taking science as the absolute truth.
Considering the functionality of adult competency in this country...that’s no real surprise. Ask those same people to solve a high school level algebra equation👀
Didn’t used to be a problem...... weird
I'm shocked. Shocked! Well, not that shocked.
This is kind of like having a smoke alarm that starts beeping after the fire has consumed the building.
How ironic.
I was bullied in grade school for being smart, decades later nothing has changed.
[Dr. Fauci is in good company here](https://www.wired.com/2011/05/a-day-to-remember-carl-sagan/)
Christianity is the problem.
Yeah no shit
Yeah not too surprised just...horribly depressed. This is what happens when you let someone like Trump into office. If the science doesn't agree with his idiocy then of course he's going to tell his base not to trust science. The damage to the collective IQ of America has been done let's hope it's reversible.
What a stupid country
hah, he is the one spreading false information.
Whhhaaa...not America where freedom of religion expression trumps all!? Nah, not us. Not where a man can build a rocket to fly up and prove that the earth is flat, only for it to fail and kill him. Even though it wouldn't have gotten as high as a Cessna 150 that he could of rented for $100 for an hour. I can't possibly see what the man means!
Yes also math, facts but sports is always first
Nah, just a justified and growing anti-government bias.
I understand this to be true, that people are idiots and think the earth is flat, vaccines cause autism etc......but I also understand doctors used to endorse cigarettes as healthy, scientists “debunked” Agent Orange claims until 1994, Lobotomies were a considered legitimate medical procedure only 60 years ago, etc...
I understand WHY people doubt science, although I don’t myself.
Fauci also admits that he lied about the efficacy of masks.
Just look at the social media comments about his objective remarks that have even slightly threatened the upcoming NFL season. He's public enemy number 1.
Conservatives call science a religion. They literally think it's a conspiracy against them

I think U.S needs to focus on their education system. There is no excuse for a country like U.S to fall so far behind other countries in education.
I'd say the aggressive circulation of carefully crafted misleading and biased misinformation from actual conservatives, far-right "alternative" sources, and outright falsified sockpuppet accounts on social media is also a fairly big issue. Unfortunately, certain individuals stand to receive substantial financial benefits by allowing this environment of artificial inflation to thrive.
Agenda and money driven science isn’t really science, and people notice that, but for people making their actual living from all that probably aren’t gonna bite the hand that feeds them, and sometimes you choose your own delusion according to your needs.
I'm honestly more concerned with 'politically-biased science' than 'anti-science bias.'
No shit
The problem is “science” whatever that means has just become a blanket term used by the establishment to discredit any dissenting voices. Actual science and people who practice it disagree all the time and are often never in full unison. “Science” is one of the most corrupt practices in the world with many scientists publishing papers they know to be false for grant money and access to obscene amounts of funding for their own benefit rather the benefit of humanity. Dr Fauci is the poster child for this corrupt system.
So, like, it's not OK to be an idiot? 

And brag about it?
The truth is for sale. Shit is broken y'all.
They are so close to the truth but the ignorant have a peculiar habit. They believe that by complicating an idea, that makes them intellectuals for being able to discern from the globalists elites lies! However, the truth is rather simple. For example, Bill Gates doesn’t want microchips. Just quantum tattoos to be able to detect who has been positive or negative. They are NOT microchips. However people when they see this think that since BILL is helping in this process of MARKING EVERYONE that somehow its a secret conspiracy. So they dig into every little nuance they can find to somehow connect hidden dots. I like Albert Einstein’s quote which reads as follows:

”The definition of genius is taking the complex and making it simple.”

Really helps out into perspective how these buffoons can think they’re somehow geniuses but completely miss the mark.
Except this is the guy who said back in March we don't need to wear masks, and just recently he comes out and says "it's because we knew that we didn't even have enough for docs".

Well if you "science" types stopped playing politics or coming to conclusions favorable to whoever sponsored the study, people might trust you more.
Fauci forgot what science is.  I have not seen any evidence of science being used in his decisions about covid19.  Science investigates things to determine what they are and how they work.
This isn’t “anti-science”.  It’s a response to the media and government feeding the people false and misleading stories to the point where the average citizen doesn’t believe anything they hear.  Prime examples: CNN telling people not to leave their homes cuz they’ll spread the virus, but then applauding protestors gathering en masse.  Then Fox News criticizes the protests yet hypes up the Trump rally in Tulsa.

Also consider the CDC and WHO telling people not to wear masks.  This is incompetence and deception at the highest levels of our government and society.
Trump finally got cnn to say his rallies are huge lol
Anti history is at an all time high
Science can be manipulated.
Catch up, Fauci.
Uh, we just call them republicans.
‘Political bias’ is a problem in the US.
It's more than just not knowing or understanding scientific principles. It's that people feel that they, themselves, have some magic ticket that exempts them from the consequences of those scientific principles.
Anti-science has always been a thing. The problem now is that social media has given people the mistaken belief that their opinions are worthy of consideration no matter their level of education or expertise.
A civil way of saying Americans are dumb as hell and its approaching crisis levels.
Anti-intellectualism as a whole.
You don’t have to be as smart as Fauci to know this
Are we talking about the anti-science bias that enabled the boogaloo boi protests?

Or are we talking about the anti-science bias that enabled the BLM protests?

https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/06/the-partisan-undermining-of-coronavirus-science/
Gee, ya think?
Yes the left lives to twist science to suit their narrative.
Quite a few years ago when I was working on my PhD in mechanical engineering, as a poor student, I would take the bus home. One of my associate asked how the program is going for me. I had to hush him because I got really uncomfortable with the stinky eyes I was getting from people around me.

It really is weird and I don't understand. My European friends say it is the opposite in Europe and apparently Asia as well where the general public tends to respect education. From what I hear, outside if the academia, it is recommended people  to not use the "Dr" title because it can often be taken negatively, unless you're a medical doctor.
Therein lies my problem; otherwise, I’ll pass
People think scientists are out to get them and are some part of a great conspiracy.
No shit. A significant portion of the U.S. populace accepts the Iron Age tale of the Sky Sorceror and the Lich Son as fact.
Obama had proposed to give citizenship to green cards to master's and Ph.D graduates in STEM fields.

I do think it is a great way to maintain America's advantage in science and technology.
And in other news, water is wet.
The calls coming from inside the house
No kidding. Fucking idiots everywhere.
Warns?  Antivax and those stupid ass crystals have been a thing for how long and were just now warning, as in it could be a problem soon?  Gtfo
Fauci needs to take a Lie Detector Test.
Is this headline from [insert any time in U.S. history]?
This shit started with the anti vaxxer crowd and has only gotten worse. We should’ve shut that down years ago.
The ultimate irony here is taking the word of an infections disease expert on an issue of sociology and cultural studies as gospel because “he’s a scientist”

When it’s demanded that “science” (selective studies and unvetted claims) is to be trusted outside of the context of the scientific method, it’s no longer science - it’s religion.
FUK science... Voodoo all da way
Warns? It arrived a while ago.
*Fascinating*
In other news, water is wet...
Is he referring to that batshit insane open letter by 1200 "health experts" about protests and covid? He's not wrong, that was as anti-science as it gets.
I choose to believe what I was PROGRAMMED to believe!!
> This man must be so fed up with ~~Americans~~ conservatives.
Yeah, he’s told them what to do and how to stay safe incredibly clearly and has had to toe the line with a moronic president who thinks this is all about him and has remained cool and diplomatic throughout, only to be villainized by conspiracy theorists and right wing nut jobs. I admire the guy a lot.
He must be fed up with one big fat American in particular
At this point he's got himself to blame. He's *still* pretending the trump admin is trying to combat coronavirus as he participates in literally the worst pandemic response in the world.

It's high time he wised up and quit lending his credibility to this murderous cover-up.
Not Americans, just the same uneducated country bumpkins that have always been an issue.
40%.
He fans the flames but the general population is very science illiterate. Most for your politicians included.
Trump is merely a symptom of the disease and not the root cause.
He knows..
It’s always a dumb time to be smart.
We can only hope it’s the end result. I see no signs of them stopping.
And yet their only answer is 'a vaccine is coming'. So ironic.
“Hurb Dur! FrUiT FliEs! Stupid scientists always doing stupid things!” -MAGA man
Yep....when science conflicts with your ideology then one choice is to ignore science. What else are you going to do......sigh.
Their war on science is just a byproduct of their endless War on Education.    Intelligent, informed people don't vote Republican.
Yup.. And now we have a bunch of miseducated people running around and they all have an opinion and access to Facebook..
Hey they have spent billions advancing science and tech for war. Why would you need good healthcare when you can have cool bombs to drop on people?
[deleted]
DAE Republicans bad?  Upvotes please.
While true, the left isn't scott-free on this. Antivax, anti-GMO and the promotion of natural remedies is prevalent in the left and liberal side of politics. These views only helps the right with it's war on science, intellectualism and facts.
Christian have "faith" they know more than the rest of us
Both parties have. We should t even have a partisan system on the first place
It's oddly communicable, and often fatal. :(
I disagree.

There might be evidence that it's an issue, but it just doesn't feel like one to me.
Okay, maybe it's just *medical science*?
People think the earth is flat. Can’t get much more anti-science than that.
Well said, that defines it quite well.
It's science when the science backs up their political opinion, and emotions when the science doesnt. On both sides of the political spectrum.
It's anti science.
Antivax? the 5g shit? People will believe anything if you say it with enough confidence like the phrase "blind as a bat", bats have eyes and they can see.
I don’t think people realize smart phones and space ships ARE science. They’re just cool and let’s you do things. Science is numbers and hard!
>	the false notion that democracy means that ‘my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.’

Democracy *does* mean that ignorance is just as good as knowledge, and I can prove that because my vote counts equally* to someone who pays zero attention, has zero education, and lives in a world of misinformation.

Anti-intellectualists live on the idea that “everyone’s entitled to their own opinion” but fail to understand not every opinion is 1) valid or 2) informed.
Poindexter, Nerd, Geek, Brainiac, Bookworm, Egghead, Bookish, Dork, Idiot Savant...

Smart folk are shamed. Always have been.
Big Joel did a video recently that targets a PragerU argument that basically amounts to "science and reason are bad, because traditionalism is good."

Edit: [link](https://youtu.be/AsZy_SXfTS0)
Asimov died nearly 30 years ago

Anti-intellectualism  is nothing new
He said this in 1980 or so, I believe.
I came here to post this.
America hates intellectuals because americans are very opinionated and think someone that speaks the truth is a danger to them. It's been going on since the country was founded. Anti-intellectualism is as old as religion but America is now the base for it.

 global warming deniers are mostly American, a person like Trump could never be elected anywhere else in the West. In recent times, the "KOCH BROTHERS" and people on their payroll like Ben Shapiro have become the leaders and the face of this movement where idiots like Ben Shapiro dismiss what thousands of scientists that have spent their lives on climate trends are saying. You will also notice that flat earthers, holocaust deniers are also majorly American. A large group of people believe slavery was justified because blacks in America are better off than Africans.

It's the things like that I've seen over the years. America needs a huge culture change.
"I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...

**― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark**

This book should be required reading for all high school students.

Or as Gingrich put it, [opinion is as valid as fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnhJWusyj4I).
In simple terms: my opinion Trumps your science. Belief is all that matters.
I started reading this like it was a tl;dr for the article. And I was so excited someone said this. Then I read who wrote it... Were fucked. No one speaks like this anymore, or uses reason to make decisions. It’s all about a vote.
Demoncracy means EXACTLY that ignorance is just as good as knowledge. You're just in denial of the weaknesses of the democratic system. There are many situations where democracy is not equipped to handle, such as this pandemic. I'd still 100% prefer democracy than tianimen square, but stop acting like it's without flaws.
"science is anti conservative" ~ conservatives
It’s funny. Quoting that on reddit.
Everything is a pendulum.  Soon we’ll swing the other way and get a new enlightenment.  


Or we’ll blow up planet. 


One of those two
And that’s always been the problem of democracy
It really points out the fact that rural states voters get 2 to 3x more voting power than metropolitan areas.
The Republican party has been loudly shouting that their ignorance is as good as scientist's expertise for decades.  This isn't so much an "americans" issue as it is a "Repbulican voter" issue.  

Democrats and liberals aren't the ones shouting that scientists are wrong.  Nor are they usually the anti-government conspiracists, instead they argue to FIX the problems with government.  

This isn't a "BoTh SiDeS" issue in any way.  One side refuses to trust experts.  Not both.
Which is really ironic considering the pathologic fealty these people have to their pastors and the ravings of dead desert nomads.
How much can you expect from a country founded then built up by people that left their home countries because: they weren’t religiously extreme enough, they got kicked out, or couldn’t succeed because of their class? Throw in a large chunk of the population that was brought as slaves/indentured servants and you’re going to get a country that’s great but also terrible in many respects.
>Americans dislike being told how to act by some higher authority.       

Unless it's God.
I’m not saying you’re right or wrong about 1918 but do you have anything to back up the claim that they did believe scientists?
Go 'way! 'Batin'!

I could go for a Starbucks
If you think Joe Rogan is the problem here you’re ignoring the truth. There is a political party trying to defund public education
Boss babes and essential oil goop peddlers too
Rogan consistently disappoints with some of the shit he says to such a large audience, but if even half of conservatives in America shared his I would be thrilled. At least the guy genuinely wants to know what’s true and not just how he can score points for his team. 
I actually see him as a really positive influence for the Bros of America. It could be so much worse.
Man such a great series!

Edit: By series, I meant both books.
I read "The Demon-Haunted World" again a few months ago and it is still so very relevant right now!   I suggest everyone who hasn't read it, do so!
[Link to a quick 116 seconds of this snippet](https://youtu.be/_QspBC9FoJo). A very relevant summary of today’s society.
>Where’s Carl Sagan when you need him

He left us just as the movie Contact was being finished. He left us at the height of hope, I'm glad he's not around to see this.
don't worry, we got Joe Rogan now

/s
Too late. We are there, and I would give my left arm to be living in Idiocracy. Oh. No plants grow? Boohoo!  We’ve got a president who is totally fine with killing us. The wrestling president LISTENED to someone about the water. Can you imagine Trump doing the same?
I wouldn't be surprised if you think the virus is a hoax.
If the data doesn't support a hypothesis, you must re-evaluate the hypothesis. It's not flip flopping. It's good science.
You meaning adapting and changing to new information? That's how science works. You have to be pretty damned stupid to think they just flip flop
Scientists don't flip flop.  That's not part of the scientific method.
The entire point is that science is refined as more information comes to light. It should be obvious that when something new and unknown comes along, many of the initial hypotheses will turn out to be wrong. The fact that our understanding changes means that something has been learned. It's not a religion.
Comparing this phenomenon to the millions of Trump supporters who hang on his every work is a vast stretch.
Oh my gosh. When you go to college, you’re the enemy. 🤦‍♀️
Even when he’s “wrong” he’s still more qualified to speak than ANYONE in your country.
Yeah it's crazy isn't it? Almost like "science" (think about this for a second, you just said that the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment "looked foolish") isn't a person or an organisation but the study of things and that scientists were constantly studying an ever evolving new entity.

But you're right, it would have been so much better for "science" to stick with the first thing "they" ever suggested for fear of being called foolish...
Science works basee on the information they have at hand... which is subject to change as new information is introduced. Pretty basic concept, my man.
Idiots make a guess and stick with it, even when all of the evidence says they're wrong.

Greater idiots see the evolution of thought to keep up with evidence as a weakness and a fault.
The U.S. needs another Sagan so bad right now...
They worked based on the information they had at the time. That clearly changed as new information was introduced. Kinda like how all branches of science work.
There is a difference between lying and being wrong at the time.
and how many people were saved because medical workers got those masks?
The guidance was wrong, no one can dispute that. 

Question: do you think it was just Fauci making this recommendation? Was it a group of only scientists? Was it the entire taks force?
I was pissed about that too... but seeing how people went crazy and hoarded everything (from toilet paper to hand sanitizer) they would have done the same to masks. 

Worst case scenario was hospitals run out of masks, nurses/doctors get sick, then hospitals have tons of sick covid patients with no one to take care of them. I suppose by lying and saying masks don't help might have protected healthcare workers and kept hospitals running. 

Realistically we had months to prepare and should have stocked up on masks so everyone can have them, then there wouldn't be a need to lie.
Republicans just spell it “Jesus”

Science and medicine evolve and charge overtime, adapting to new information. If newer science and medicine proves older stuff wrong that is progress. It's incredibly small minded to use that as an excuse not to actually trust it. The next step from there is anti-vaxxers and flat earther that "do their own research"
Remember when Bill Nye lost his shit? Scientists the country over must be close to just collectively saying “fuck this, we’re out”
As they shit on science with their high tech smartphones or computers. Their whole lives revolve around science and they can't make that connection. It's crazy.
That’s gonna go over a lot of heads
Why?
But you do, right?
Rogan has been spewing skepticism around wearing a mask in public.
Freedom is so far up my ass my farts whistle the star spangled banner while I take a shit
You might have some shit to work out. +1 877-648-6947
Any evidence to support your claim
No, it didn’t. Trump did.
Science is the best tool we have for understanding the world. Of course it's not absolute truth. It's all tentative, by definition. But any alternative is inevitably going to be less correct.
I’d like to hear more of what you’re talking about
Ah yes, “the left”. The ominous being looming in the shadows, determined to destroy your way of life by *checks notes* telling you to wear masks to help protect others around you
Lots of liberals in California are anti-vax. 

Americans are just dumb top to bottom.

And it’s not like he doesn’t passionately care for his people. When Ebola came to the US he donned PPE to personally treat the patients. He cares and he’s being shat on by brainwashed sheep. I hope Biden wins in November and gives him a medal, he absolutely deserves it.
I love the guy, but the 'we don't need to wear masks, leave them for healthcare professionals' wasn't great. I obviously see the reasoning why, but that really just added fuel to the "we don't need masks" fire.
What a dumb thing to say!
If anything, they're picking up the pace. Their tribe will have a totally separate past and present from recorded events, packaged and sold to anyone that's afraid of their kid coming home from school and asking f---y questions about massacres and human rights.
I keep telling people that this is only the beginning. The next tough part will be if we even get the correct vaccine with no side effects and is dirt cheap the Republicans will still tell their voters not to take it, especially if it comes from a Biden administration.
No their answer is “how can you get rid of the virus unless we build up immunity! Sorry!”
>  they know more than the rest of us

it's not even that.  it's that what's in The Bible (and really not even all the material there) is the most important stuff to know, if not **the only stuff** that's important to know.

After all, The Bible came from ***GOD HIMSELF*** and anything else merely came from imperfect, non-omniscient, mortal-and-eventually-dead humans. So, "stick with the stuff that will always be true, coming from the being who was always there & will always be there, the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End"

The Bible is long & takes a while to learn ... but once you've got that down, that's all you ever need to know!

/s
My non-religious, Trump supporting father has faith that perfect evidence exists which will prove all of his beliefs and opinions to be absolutely accurate. He's just never seen that evidence and he won't look for it.
Well, their God smited a few pastors with the COVID.
Which position on the Democratic platform is anti-science?
That's bullshit.  The two parties aren't remotely similar any more, and Democrats believe in education and science.  The evidence is everywhere.

Compare any one of Cuomos' 111 pandemic briefings to the shit show that was the WH briefings with Mango Mussolini.
That's survival of the fittest fam
I see what you did there...
You forgot to link us to a YouTube video you found while doing your "research"!
You clever devil. How's that working out for you?
Nah. It’s science that doesn’t conform to political narrative. Like that bullshit Trump lied he was taking awhile back in the same meeting he said shining ultraviolets up our ass or whatever he was spewing: THAT medical science is fine. Dialysis, whatever drugs all the overweight cart riding trump voters take, that science is fine too.
Yea but they’re either attention whores or just dumb. So yea sure that’s anti-science. And freedom of speech and stuff. But their opinion is irrelevant.
Oh yeah, well I think its flat and riding on the back of a giant turtle, suck on that einstein
Oh for sure. Pro-/anti-science sentiment does not have a bias between political views. But nor does science care much about ANY opinion :)
>On both sides of the political spectrum.

False.
In reality, science is science, regardless of political leaning.
I write all that shit and all you can say is “no, u?” :)
Of course. But dumb people have been dumb and controlled by their emotions since forever. These are the zealots who are either trained or wired a certain way to only accept gospel from usually an alpha male. These people can’t be untrained. All they can do is get to a point where their god isn’t gonna save them, and make the choice to maybe open their mind or get darwin’d.

Is what it is. Can’t save everyone, especially those who refuse to save themselves.

The internet had created a huge feedback loop where these types find easier validation than the usual path they’d be on (the village idiot or the silent type ready to explode at some point). But their personality type isn’t new.

Edit: clarity.
Of course not. Explaining how an iPhone works and that it’s build upon foundations that go to Gutenberg in the 1440s, they’d rather just hear a god put the blueprints in Steve Jobs’ head.

Science is curiosity, and building upon everything we know to push further.

Anti science is wanting not to ask and hoping nothing changes, because that’d be inconvenient.
Depending on your state, your vote might actually mean LESS
Asimov was saying that democracy (social equality) props up the belief that one's opinions are therefore equivalent to anybody else's thoughts in *any* arena of knowledge, such as medicine, law or science (for example).

He was not talking about just the political arena.
> Democracy does mean that ignorance is just as good as knowledge,

No, it doesn't: democracy makes no moral judgments vis-a-vis ignorance or knowledge.

All it does is say that everyone gets equal participation.
And this is why you need an educated population to have a functioning democracy.

Q.E.D.
Well said.  I hate when people’s rebuttals are “well, that’s my opinion” .  I mean, you can think what you want, but doesn’t mean its a logical and rational thought out opinion.
Well stated.
My thoughts have coalesced around this idea but never condensed to a point, thank you for putting this into such simple words.
>Anti-intellectualists live on the idea that "everyone's entitled to their own opinion" but fail to understand not every opinion is 1) valid or 2) informed.

or worth the same on various subjects...
> Anti-intellectualists live on the idea that "everyone's entitled to their own opinion" but fail to understand not every opinion is 1) valid or 2) informed.

Also two important details is that they can't distinguish opinion from fact, and they lack the ability to defer to experts.
That sounds like big science talk!
It's the unfortunate tradeoff for a fair democratic system.
In theory there is an exchange of ideas that eventually causes better ways of doing things to win out over worse ways of doing things.  When the whole system depends on huge bodies of lies ranging from supply-side economics to subsidized fossil fuel prices, we don't get that exchange of ideas.  Partisan clashes are always comically stupid because even the lesser evil is just getting one or two baby steps closer to honesty than its counterpart.  Virtue signalling while maintaining the status quo isn't actually any sort of opposition.  Without that *earnest* political opposition to this long-standing regime of Reaganomic militancy, all areas of clash will be light-years removed from any dialectic that might uplift observers or participants.
And these people have been holding us back for decades. Richard Hofstadter won a Pulitzer Prize for his book Anti-Intellectualism in American Life back in 1964.
Voting should require school transcripts and IQ tests imo.  Tired of dumbasses stacking the deck for the racist regime.
> Anti-intellectualists live on the idea that "everyone's entitled to their own opinion" but fail to understand not every opinion is 1) valid or 2) informed.

Not only that, but many anti-intellectualists live on the idea that certain verifiable falsehoods can be opinions in the first place. That's just ignoring objective facts. Can't really call that an opinion.
Or as one of my high school peers so succinctly stated, "Smart people are so stupid."
Do you have the link?
Dennis Prager is on record a ton saying he is fully supportive of science. He actually thinks the only thing people should take at college is STEM or professional programs.
Yep.

Also, Asimov died of AIDS due to being infected by HIV-contaminated blood during a heart procedure. He made the decision to not release news of his illness publicly to help protect his wife and children from the stigma that would have swirled around the cause of his death.

He was right to do so.
> America hates intellectuals because americans are very opinionated and think someone that speaks the truth is a danger to them.

Maybe it's because it's a glorified version seen in retrospect. But I feel like technology, science, and intellectuals are praised in the aftermatch of WWII. You had things like the world fair which showcased the world of tomorrow, future and current technologies to make life easier. The wonders of plastic, space travel, etc.

Were these events and the praise the people involved with them an outlier in American society back then? Or was there a culture change that made people distrust science?

I know with vaccines their creation was seen as wonderful as people were dealing with them diseases in daily life. AntiVaxxers don't see the modern benefit because of how successful and accepted they were in the past, leading to "Why do we need vaccine X if disease Y is gone" mentality. Plus the "cause" of autism.

Speaking openly I feel like ignorant people did always exist, but without a platform nobody cared and they couldn't organize with like minded folks. I know Moon Land deniers were one of the larger crazy groups before the internet. But the internet created this ultimate platform to spread anti-intellectualism bullshit.
Fucking love this book.  The anecdote about getting a ride home from his father’s friend was particularly good IMO.
I explained further down that:

Asimov was saying that democracy (social equality) props up the belief that one's opinions are therefore equivalent to anybody else's thoughts in any arena of knowledge, such as medicine, law or science (for example).

He was not talking about just the political arena.

Democracy is the least flawed of any political system that I've seen. Also, the only system that is inherently built to be repaired.
There does exist some anti-science on each side, honestly. Democrats and liberals tend to be anti-GMO still, for instance, and anti-vaxxers are also often liberals. Climate change does depend on partisanship a lot, though.
> Democrats and liberals

How many genders are there?
Narrator: He doesn’t.
It's what plants crave
I know dude, I know. But if he were here he’d be on the front page of every media outlet speaking out in the name of science. His voice is missed
You are right, living in Idiocracy would be better than today.  I stand corrected.
Trump is a wrestling president too. He's in the WWE hall of fame. 

Haha but yeah trump is too good or smart to listen to anybody
They certainly were in 1968...
Best way I've ever heard it put is: "Science *knows* it doesn't know everything. Otherwise, it'd stop."
[removed]
Silent majority. People like me realizing things like this are why trump won last time. I never woke up and said I’m voting trump but after all of this, yes. Enough is enough
You need evidence to know these peoples voices becoming more and more prominent is a bad thing?
In Chinese labos then? That guy really owns everything. what a boss.
:( i dont think i belong here.
"liberals" but your point still stands
Anecdotally, the stupid CA anti-vax liberals I know of in my broader social network are getting pulled to the right by the battle lines around covid.

[More-informed people than myself seem to be seeing the same thing](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/06/the-anti-vax-movements-radical-shift-from-crunchy-granola-purists-to-far-right-crusaders/?fbclid=IwAR0kmfA1gFyB4f2wB25DbeXE8Ikwxi6fQtoBvYBypYL98ta9ZnmXNAfGXuA).
Anti vaxxers are more like independents that claim to be liberal because it's the 'in' thing to do where they live.
He definitely deserves something of praise since he’s been the only reasonable voice Americans have had from the pandemic and has managed to avoid direct retribution i.e. firings that Trump is famous for issuing
The war of native aggression
They’ve achieved escape velocity from reality, now they’re seeing if they have the fuel to go to another reality entirely.
Oh god. They'll brand it as the Biden Injection or something.

Yeah, call me crazy but I prefer the Christians who think of the Bible as a semi-useful book of fables to the ones who believe the whole thing was written word for word by an omnipotent deity who will eternally torture anyone who varies from [their own personal interpretation of] his instructions.
There both just as bad just on different ends of the spectrum
Except more educated/wealthy/"smart" people tend to have fewer offspring...
It's survival of the fittest gene pool. Saying otherwise is Social Darwinism, which doesn't have anything to do with natural selection but sure is reactionary.
Being held up by Atlas.
Yep, I have to throw that last line in there or else everyone will think that it's only the political party that they happen to disagree with which behaves this way. Nope, the one you like does too. Everyone fact checks the stuff they don't want to believe, so they see all the opposing groups lies. Fact checking the things that one would expect to be true is far more important.
The problem is, science gets twisted all the time by people who are smart enough to understand but dumb enough to make others believe how they interpreted the hypothesis. It’s sad to think that people cannot understand the truth behind a lot of scientific discoveries.
>Pro-/anti-science sentiment does not have a bias between political views.

One party is anti-science. The other isn't
Who are your paragons of truth?
Anti-vax? Anti-nuclear? Republicans are way worse but it is a thing.
Absolutely! That idea was too much to type out in full, though, and I felt like it would invite *a lot* of argument, but [you're 100% correct.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wC42HgLA4k)
As someone who lives in a deep blue part of NJ, my Presidential vote is is probably worth 10% of what it would be across the border in Pennsylvania.

My educated, compassionate, informed, coastal elite vote in California means absolutely fuck all at the national level.  

I use my money for national politics and my vote for local politics.  

I mean I still vote nationally but I recognize that being a Californian it doesn’t mean much.
Your educated vote might mean less
Yeah if you have a bunch of universities
imagine being a democratic voter in CA
Even Plato hated democracy and said that it eventually leads to oligarchy and chaos
You’re using the word “mean“ to mean “defined as”.   

I’m using the word “mean“ in the same sense that OP used it...as in “yields a belief that”, which should have been assumed thru context of the conversation.
And if you're very wealthy, you get even more equal participation.
And this is why so many are adamantly against educating the population.
But why insist on spreading democracy to countries that do not yet have an educated population?  And indeed, demonize them for not having a democracy?
nah we are, recently burned myself on a 3d printer
Or they just call them gay for liking science and getting good grades. 
 
Jokes on them, I'm bi!
https://youtu.be/AsZy_SXfTS0
Lol. How do you want me to respond? By, idk, linking you to virtually any PragerU video so you can see for yourself that it's not really his style?
Not sure when the cultural shift happened, but I’d agree that innovation and intellect was valued at one point. In certain fields, it still is (science, medicine, and the arts). I can’t say for certain *when* or *why* this shift happened, but I might venture to guess around the turn of the millennia (1994-2004) when we as a nation could more readily see that we could be harmed for our opinions and way of life (Oklahoma City bombings, WTC bombing one and two, etc.) And a lot of these conflicts were direct results of the anti-war and pro-war conflict of the 60s with Vietnam. But I don’t know if that’s where this whole disaster began.
My guess is ruthless competition. If you lose the science race your army gets slaughtered, or you get nuked, or you lose the space race or some such. 

Coasting on "Murica gr8" means we dont have to push anymore and thus can disregard science, with no hard tangible negative effects for decades. And people are shortsighted
Sputnik and the cold war made us care about science. And the cold war did give us nearly every aspect of modern technology. Would not have been profitable otherwise.
Yes agreed. Democracy is the best system, and the best system got us Trump, and probably 4 more years of Trump.
Exactly. Its not one side, both sides have crazies that deny science. The fundamental problems ends up being a lack of true education.
I’d say the same about Neil Degrass Tyson.  You saw what happened to him.

No true Scotsman, eh?
Wait until they hear about the super computer in their pocket!
NAnO mAcHIneS, SON.
hahaha that's hilarious
What
Yea. Unfortunately fact checking is for self validation, not education.

But there are differences in what we self select to fact check.

Like, I’m not going to look up the authenticity of a New Testament verse because I literally don’t care enough about it to even care if someone lies to me about some scripture.

At the same time, someone else is not going bother fact checking some statement I make about Eisenhower’s approach to logistics because they too don’t care :)

It’s only the hot button issues that drive some people to CNN and others to FOX.
Right, totally. At the same time, the average person doesn’t understand the science oftentimes, so they need an interpreter.

It’s the same thing that differentiate news reporting and news analysis. 

The bias comes from the interpreter/analysis. And that comes because most people don’t know anything unless someone tells them. There’s too much going on to be everywhere at once.

Just gotta be careful to not take anything at face value. An event should make you CURIOUS, not automatically fulfilled.
>Anti-vax?

The left doesn't promote anti-vax.

>Anti-nuclear?

Those who oppose nuclear, do so for legitimate reason....

I'd like a legitimate example that proves your "both sides" false equivalency.
Anti-vax goes across party lines unfortunately. 

Nuclear isn't clear cut science at all. There are plenty of drawbacks that could push a person against it.
Only in America can you take something as simple as "more votes = win" and complicate it and fuck it up so bad people lose interest and don't care.... Wait a minute...
That video came out in 2011 so two elections have taken place since then. It mentioned that 3/55 of the elections had the loser of the popular vote win due to the electoral college for around a 5% error rate. Now it’s 4/57, so now 7% of elections had the loser of the popular vote win the election. It’s so irritating.
You think that’s bad, I live in CA. My (National election) vote is worth less than 1/60th of someone in Montana.
In case one goes bad
The United States is a one dakota state, but with American extravagance they have two of them.
Two is one and one is none.
Necessary to maintain the balance of slave and free state count like 200 years ago.
Well, looks like he was right.
This isn't entirely accurate. His earlier works were anti democracy, notably in The Republic.

But he changed his views in his later works.
No, I'm not doing the thing you say: I'm saying democracy *doesn't imply the belief you're claiming*.

Democracy doesn't mean that the ignorant and wise vote on what is real, or mean that the ignorant and wise are both just as capable of any given task: it's just a belief about how to govern societies made up of people. Believing in equal treatment under the law doesn't mean you believe that everyone is of equal worth or is of equal merit or is equally capable of a given task or "just as good" in any sense: it just means you don't think the government should make that determination.
Some men just wanna watch the world burn.
Because the intent is generally not to spread democracy, but to have casus belli to assert your own authority. There's a reason why vietnamese unification fell through.
Because that's just the marketing. Spreading "democracy" around the world makes a lot of money for Lockhead, and Raytheon, and General Dynamics, and Gruman, and you get the idea.
3D printers aren't for "smart" people, literally anyone can buy one for $250, download a 3D model and press print with zero technical knowledge.
The notion that educated people can never make dumb mistakes, but everyone else can.
Same. Wanna hang out after COVID?
Never heard of PragerU. I don't know if it's actually hilarious or sad what they say.  
anyway thanks for the link
Education in science specifically. It's fairly proven that the more people learn about science, the more they believe in it.
Thx
Darwin didn't ever say "survival of the fittest". That was [Herbert Spencer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer). 

>There must also be a population of replicating entities and variations  between them that affect fitness – variation that must be heritable. By  itself, survival of the fittest is a dead end. Business people are  especially guilty of confusing survival of the fittest with evolution.
They are literally like chapters in the history books
Anti vax was definitely a white so-cal liberal thing
Literally a founding part of the country is that farmers votes count more than city folks.
I thinks it stupid. But it’s there.
[deleted]
I think the original intention was that the USA was supposed to be more like the EU. And each "state" was its own country in a weird sense. So thats why we have the weird electoral votes and all that.

It's something we should absolutely get rid of now though. It's especially dumb since larger states are at a disadvantage, despite being so important to this country financially and for other reasons.
The intentions were initially good as otherwise the only areas any politician would pay attention to is the largest population centers.  Every demographic deserves a voice, however like all systems it's open to manipulation and manipulated it has been.
They both went bad...
Turns out, we needed three Dakotas
I agree, but it seems a bit pedantic. Basically "Democracy results in the beliefs of ignorant and wise people being counted equally." versus "Democracy means the ignorant and wise are counted equally."

I took some license in rephrasing, but the sentiment of each is nearly the same. Obviously there is a clear distinction, but typically not one that is necessary to point out in ordinary conversation.
You’re reading my comment super narrowly focused on the word “mean”. 

Broaden your scope to this one thread. 

Your assumption is that I’m talking about what democracy means *as a system of government*. 

I’m not, which you would figure out thru context when the original poster’s quote *also* didn’t literally define democracy, but spoke to it as a POV of a layman.

I’m taking about what *laymen who live in a democracy have be taught to believe* — that no matter who they are or what they think, their “entitled to their own opinion”, which they are, but we teach in a way that conflates that with “all opinions are equally valid and informed”, which they are not. 

Let’s try it ankthwr way, without using the words “mean” or “democracy” in the hopes that you’ll look past that narrow view: Since all of us have the theoretically same voting power, ignorant/less-informed people believe all opinions are equal. And they aren’t. 

If you don’t get what I’m saying now, I’ve lost hope and am done trying.
If someone were above average intelligence and they burned themselves on fire, would you say fire isn’t for smart people? It was just a dumb moment they shared.
Oh man, you could spend the next month just watching people tackle their videos. I could recommend some, but instead I'll link [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdjtfnD9syhELt9GQ5ick2ByFOitpfhC7) of PragerU YouTube Poops. I hope you like the phrase "urine and feces".
False. Anti-vax was a russian misinformation campaign on Facebook/social media, that some people fell for. 

Let me repeat myself: **The left doesn't promote anti-vax.**
*I love democracy*

Edit: My first gold! Thank you kind stranger, I shall cherish it.
It's somehow to "protect the little guy," even though most "little guys" rent in cities rather than own land in Wyoming. Also, isn't the senate already our mechanism for making sure that low-population states' interests are covered?
That's not really true. States in the late 1700s had populations that varied *significantly*, and it was not due to an urban-rural divide. The population of Virginia alone made up approximately 1/5 of the total population of the colonies. For the several states with populations of about 50,000 to 100,000, the question would be: *why join a union and surrender some sovereignty if we'll never have any say?*



Hence, the compromise whereby states were represented by two senators each (appointed by the states themselves and not directly elected at the time), and the people were represented proportionately. This compromise followed through to the election of the president.




Anyway, it really had nothing to do with farmers or city dwellers. It would be more appropriate to say that the system was designed to make a Virginia's vote worth less than those in other states.
going into that a little deeper, well, it was also on founded on the principal that *slave owner votes count more*

basically without the slave population of the south, for example, Virginia, there wouldn't be enough "eligible voters" to allow southerners to win national elections (this was a time where people didn't know much outside of their locality, so state/local popularity was much more influential on politics).  afaik, VA had the largest slave population in the US for many years.

guess where the majority of the first few presidents were from?
How many times you gonna drop that same comment?
You do that ... and we're all Californians or New Yorkers.

(Because they got the money and the votes to run the whole show.)
We just need to give them more votes. East and west Dakota?
>  Obviously there is a clear distinction, but typically not one that is necessary to point out in ordinary conversation.

*Normally* no but it's *specifically relevant* to the Isaac Asimov quote that started this all off and the way the above poster disagreed with the idea that the notion is false.
> I’m taking about what laymen who live in a democracy have be taught to believe — that no matter who they are or what they think, their “entitled to their own opinion”, which they are, but we teach in a way that conflates that with “all opinions are equally valid and informed”, which they are not.

They're not taught that because it has anything to do with democracy: they're taught that by scammers who want to take advantage of them, almost always through undemocratic mechanisms.
Sauce?
The irony that you're treating the claim "Democrats aren't anti-science" as unfalsifiable is too good. 

Science isn't a body of knowledge, it's a method of inquiry.  Saying everything that exists contra to your thesis is a "Russian hoax" is in itself anti-scientific and that shit is *absolutely fucking rampant* among a certain kind of capital D Democrat.  

And to head off some of the cognitive dissonance this is going to cause:  I'll drag my dick through a mile of broken glass before I vote Republican.
Me too, but not in a sarcastic way like your cynical comment.
Dew it
Legit, I love the part about 90’s
obligatory "something, something, republic, something, something, state's rights."

The antiquated system is rooted in protecting the interests of southern slaveholders from rural states from their creditors in northern urban highly populated states. The omitted 3/5ths clause, which allowed rural slave states to count slaves towards their representation in Congress attests to the true nature of the system.

Our representative system needs to be reformed, it has outlived it's worth. There's no reason Montana a state with 500,000 people should have the same amount of senators as California, a state with 40 million.
I like the sequel to 1945, 1984
It’s almost like it’s intentional or something.
I don't think that a president should be able to win an election by only focusing on the major cities. It's good to give everyone a voice. And this is coming from someone who lives in a major city.
So instead we're all Alabama. Thanks a lot.
I don't see the issue.
I re-read the comment chain, and I tend to agree. I think that I'm wrong about any pedantry and that it's a proper distinction to make upon closer examination of the Asimov quote.

It seems Asimov is condemning the spread of ignorant people believing their political beliefs are as valuable as those who are educated in politics. My apologies.
Ok
You made the claim. Prove your claim that the left pushed anti-vax. I'll wait.
They're quoting Star Wars
Would be great if the us was a democracy.
The book is actually Animal Farm, it came out in 1945
That's kinda the point I guess.
That's not how The Force works!
right on
